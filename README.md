In this hackathon, the challenge is to optimize the placement of
Nturb , 50 wind turbines of 100 m rotor diameter and 100 m height each on a hypothetical 2D offshore wind farm area such that the AEP (Annual Energy Production) of the farm
is maximized. The farm area for this problem is square in shape having dimensions:
length Lx = 4 km, width Ly = 4 km. The orientation of farm is such that one of its
edges is parallel to the geographical North direction. See Figure 1. There it can be
assumed that the positive y and x axis shown are aligned with the geographical North
and East directions respectively.
There are two constraints that must not be violated by a wind farm layout to be con-
sidered valid.

<ul>
<li> Perimeter Constraint. All the turbines must be located inside the perimeter of
the farm, while maintaining a minimum clearance of 50 meters from the farm
boundary.
 </li>
 <li>
 Proximity Constraint. The distance between any two turbines must be larger than
a given security threshold to ensure a longer lifetime of the turbine rotors. This
minimum distance between two turbines is called Dmin and needs to be 400 m.
